As an SEO-savvy content strategist, create a comprehensive blog post outline using
the following inputs:

¶/ Title: "{title}"

·/ SEO Keywords: "{targetKeyword}"

¸/ Research & Brainstorm:
{researchData}

¹/ Business Context:
- Business: {businessName}
- Type: {businessTypeIdentifier}
- Location: {location}
- Services: {services}

... [Internal Links section remains unchanged] ...

Develop a detailed structure with the following specifications:

1/- Overall Structure:

• Create main headings and subheadings

• Ensure high keyword density while maintaining natural language flow

• Naturally mention {businessName} and their services where relevant

• Integrate the following services naturally throughout the content:
- {service1}
- {service2}
...

2/- Assign word counts to each section totaling 1,000 words:

¶. Introduction (100 words)
·. Main Body (750 words distributed across 4-5 H2 sections)
¸. Conclusion (75 words)
¹. FAQ Section (75 words)

3/- For each main section, provide:

• Key points to cover

• Relevant statistics or data to include from research

• Potential examples or case studies

• Suggested visuals (images, infographics, videos)

• Where to naturally integrate internal links

4/- **CRITICAL INJECTION:** For each main section, adhere to these mandates:

• Key points to cover

• Relevant statistics or data to include from research

• Potential examples or case studies

• Suggested visuals (images, infographics, videos)

• Where to naturally integrate internal links

• **[Insight_Constraint]**: The key points for each H2 must be the **most compelling, non-obvious piece of information** available from the research. If the research is generic, the key point must be a **critical evaluation** or **contrarian view** of the industry standard.

• **[Novelty_Mandate]**: For the Introduction's key points, include a **single, controversial, or highly specialized claim** that serves as the article's core thesis. **Do not simply summarize the title or topic.**

5/- FAQ Section:

... [FAQ section remains unchanged] ...

6/- Throughout the outline:

... [Remaining rules remain unchanged] ...

**[Thinking_Process]**: Before generating the final JSON outline, perform a brief internal review. Identify the 3 most overused, generic, or common clichés in the `Research & Brainstorm` section, and explain how the proposed outline structure will **avoid or subvert** those clichés to deliver a higher degree of insight. **DO NOT include this thought process or the Thinking_Process tag in the final JSON output.**
